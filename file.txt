Finland missed out on a play-off spot for the World Cup finals as goals from Karim Benzema and Kylian Mbappe gave France victory in Helsinki.
Finland began the night second in the group but the defeat saw them overtaken by Ukraine, who won 2-0 against Bosnia-Herzegovina.
Substitute Benzema combined with Mbappe for the opening goal for France, who had already sealed top spot in Group D.
In-form Mbappe then scored his fifth goal of this international break.
His strike in Helsinki followed his four-goal performance in the 8-0 win against Kazakhstan on Saturday that sealed his side's progress to the finals in Qatar.
